## Description
This project showcases a basic implementation of push notifications using JavaScript. It leverages the Notification API to send sample notifications to the user's browser. Additionally, it offers the capability to send reminder notifications to users who may be temporarily unavailable or away from the website, providing them with notification prompts or updates.

## Getting Started
Run the development server:

```bash
npx serve
# or
npx http-server
```
If you're using `npx serve`:
Open [http://localhost:3000] in your web browser. 

or if your are using `npx http-server`:
Open [http://localhost:8080] in your web browser.
